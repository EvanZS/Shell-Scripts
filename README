This is a tool designed to unpack, install, add the Java Development Kit to your PATH, and also re-add it to your PATH on every restart.

                              Installation
                            +++++++++++++++
                   1)Download The Linux ARM HardFP ABI.
                *Make sure it is in your Downloads Folder!
                   2)Open up the Terminal Application.
                   3)Type in ". javaInstall.sh"
                   4)Type in "INSTALL"
                          You're Finished!!
*Everytime you restart the computer or open a new Terminal, you will have to re-run the program and type in "SET"*

   
    *NOTE* This tool is made for a computer with an ARM processer, and therefore should not be used with any other type of computer *NOTE*
    *NOTE* I will try to keep this updated with the newest builds for the arm processer, right now it will only work with the December 19, 2013 build *NOTE*
