This is a tool designed to unpack, install, add the Java Development Kit to your PATH, and also re-add it to your PATH on every restart.   
    *NOTE* This tool is made for a computer with an ARM processer, and therefore should not be used with any other type of computer *NOTE*
    *NOTE* I will try to keep this updated with the newest builds for the arm processer, right now it will only work with the December 19, 2013 build *NOTE*
